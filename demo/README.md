In the demo.py a direct implementation of the get_similar_pyaudio_metric function (as introduced in 4.3 of the ipynb notebook) is written.

It applies to any wav song and returns 5 "similar"(see py file or ipynb file section 4.3) songs from the database of the 170 songs.

The py file loads data from the accompanying all_features.pickle file as well.
